# Introduction

Year after year more and more people choose to travel via air. Commercial aviation accounts for over 5% of annual GDP in The United States resulting in the operation of over 26,000 flights both foreign and domestic, carrying 2.6 million passengers daily (Airlines for America). According to the FAA, commercial aviation currently generates over 10,000,000 American jobs (FAA). The dataset chosen for this study is a part of the nycflights13 library in R. This dataset highlights all commercial flights departing from the three major airports in the vicinity of New York City, John F. Kennedy (JFK), LaGuardia (LGA), and Newark (EWR), in the calendar year of 2013. The airports highlighted in this study are amongst the busiest in The United States, JFK ranks 6th at 26.9 million passengers annually, EWR ranks 13th at 21.6 million passengers annually, and LGA ranks 19th at 14.4 million passengers annually (Baran).  The library nycflights13 contains 5 separate tables that are linked together in a relational database schema. For this project, most all exploratory data analysis and model construction will be conducted using data found in the flights and weather tables, while other data tables will be referenced to help generate questions and draw potential conclusions from the exploratory data analysis process. This study aims to explore distributions, relationships, and employ classification and clustering techniques in regards to flight delay times. 

## Background

With the rise in data-driven decision making, big data analytics has taken on a variety of different use cases in the commercial aviation industry, one of the most popular use cases being flight delay prediction. More than 20% of commercial flights experience an arrival delay of over 15 minutes, leading to both logistic and economic challenges for airlines and passengers alike. Previous studies have employed popular machine learning techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering with the goal of accurately predicting delay times. 
“Airline delay prediction by machine learning algorithms” used decision tree, cluster classification, and random forest to examine flight delays between US and Iranian airways. The study concluded that the most significant variables contributing to flight delay times are visibility, wind, and departure time. 
“Machine learning approach for flight departure delay prediction and analysis” utilized support vector machines to investigate patterns of delays at the three major New York airports. The study concluded that the most influential contributing factors to arrival delay include pushback delay, traffic volume, and weather. 
“Machine learning techniques for analysis of Egyptian flight delay” employed a variety of different decision trees to classify flight delays in Egyptian Airlines flight data. The accuracy of each model was compared with the highest accuracy percentage for a decision tree built being 83%.

# The Data
```{r data loading, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("NYCF.csv")
```

## Source

The data used comes from the R library nycflights13. This library is built upon a database schema as seen below. The flights table includes every flight from the calender year of 2013 that departed one of New York Cities three major airports, John F. Kennedy (JFK), LaGuardia (LGA), and Newark (EWR). The flights table contains flights of over 4,000 commercial aircraft flying to 105 unique destinations both foreign and domestic. The weather table includes Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) data by the hour at each airport.

## Variables

The inner_join() function was use to concatenate the flights and weather table.The data frame constructed contains 336,776 total observations and 29 variables. Each observation represents a flight departing from one of the three airports mentioned above. 

1) Year: Integer, being nycflights13 all observations are recorded as 2013
2) Month: Integer, 1 signifies January and so on to 12 for December. This will be converted to a factor as month should be treated as a categorical variable for this analysis
3) Day: Integer, day of the month that the recorded flight departed
4) Dep_time: Integer, departure time of flight recorded in 24-hour standard time
5) Sched_dep_time: Integer, scheduled departure time of flight recorded in 24-hour standard time
6) Dep_delay: Double precision, difference between scheduled departure time and actual departure time, positive value signifies a departure delay while a negative value signifies the flight left early
7) Arr_time: Integer, arrival time of flight recorded in 24-hour standard time
8) Sched_arr_time: Integer, scheduled arrival time of flight recorded in 24-hour standard time
9) Arr_delay: Double precision, difference between scheduled arrival time and actual arrival time, positive value signifies an arrival delay while a negative value signifies the flight arrived early
10)	Carrier: Character, two letter abbreviation for the airline conducting the flight
11)	Flight: Integer, three or four digit code that signifies the flight number
12)	Tailnum: Character, the tail number of the aircraft that conducted the flight

# Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=flights, aes(x=as.factor(month),fill=origin))+
  geom_bar()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Number of Flights per Month by Origin",x="Month",y="Count",fill="Origin")
xtabs(~origin+as.factor(month), flights)
```
Through the bar plot it is evident that their is a increase in number of flight operations in both the summer months and winter months. The trend of increase and decrease in total operations over the months is standard across all three airports. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=flights, aes(x=fct_infreq(carrier)))+ 
  geom_bar(fill="steelblue",color="black",alpha=0.5)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Barplot of Number of Flights by Carrier",x="Carrier",y="Count")
xtabs(~carrier, flights)
```
The bar plot above showcases the total number of fights conducted in 2013 by carrier. The top 5 airlines operating the most flight out of the three major airports in the New York City vicinity are United Airlines (UA), JetBlue (B6), ExpressJet (EV), Delta (DL), and American (AA). All five of these airlines use either JFK, or EWR as a hub. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=flights, aes(x=fct_infreq(origin)))+ 
  geom_bar(fill="steelblue",color="black",alpha=0.5)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Barplot of Number of Flights by Origin",x="Origin",y="Count")
xtabs(~origin, flights)
```

Newark operated the most flights in 2013, with Kennedy and LaGuardia following closely.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=flights, aes(x=distance, fill=carrier))+ 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Histogram of Flight Distance by Carrier",x="Distance",y="Count",fill="Carrier")
```
The histogram above reveals that the largest concentration of flight destinations fall around 1,000 miles of New York City. The outlier seen at 5,000 miles is a direct flight operated by Hawaiian Airlines from Kennedy to Honolulu. 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=dep_delay, color=origin))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.3)+
  labs(title="Departure Delay Density by Origin",y="Density",x="Departure Delay",color="Origin")+
  theme_bw()+ xlim(-30,120)
by(flights$dep_delay, flights$origin, summary)
```

The departure delay density by origin is fairly similar but it does appear the LGA has the highest density of flights leaving early and EWR experiencing a greater density of delays. Examining summary statistics we can see this is true. Newark (EWR) had a mean departure delay time of 15.11 minutes, Kennedy (JFK) had a mean departure delay time of 12.11 minutes, and LaGuardia (LGA) had a mean departure delay time of 10.35 minutes.

                alpha=0.5, color="black" )+
  labs(title="Origin vs Mean Departure Delay",x="Origin",y="Mean Departure Delay")
```
As mentioned earlier, their was a difference in mean departure delay times by origin. But, the error bar plot above confirms that the difference is not statistically significant.

Examining each of the lollipop graphs above their are a few initial key takeaways. First, fairly straight forward and expected, a low average departure delay for a given airline typically leads to a low average arrival delay. Second, a trend is established between flight distance and time made up in the air. The airlines with higher mean flight distances also experience a greater makeup of time in the air. This trend does have an outlier though, Frontier (F9). Despite having one of the longest average flight distances, on average they lose time in the air. Frontier also experiences the highest average departure and arrival delay. Contrary to Frontier, Alaska (AS) has the earliest mean arrival times, and the greatest time made up in the air on average. Like Frontier, Alaska is also in the top 4 airlines for longest mean flight distance. Similar to Alaska (AS) is Hawaiian (HA). Hawaiian Airlines has one of the lowest average departure and arrival delay times, with the longest mean flight distance, and second in mean time made up in the air. The relationships shown in the lollipop graphs tend to signify a strong correlation between distance and time made up in the air. As well as time made up in the air and arrival delay.

```{r echo=FALSE}

  geom_density(alpha=0.3)+
  labs(title="Scheduled Takeoff Density",x="Scheduled Departure Time",y="Density")+
  theme_bw()
```

The density plot above highlights the density of departing flights from the three airports. JFK operates the most international flights of the three airports. This is seen through the density plot with the greatest density of flights leaving either morning or late evening. EWR operates a more equal balance of domestic and international flights, so the mid-day dip in departure density is less pronounced. LGA operates mostly domestic flights, in turn there density plot for departures is much flatter signifying a steadier flow of traffic throughout the day. 

```{r echo=FALSE}

  ylim(0,25)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12))
```
The line plot for mean departure delay by month is rather telling. It follow the same trend seen above pertaining to number of flights per month.

```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

  labs(title="Visibility vs Mean Departure Delay",x="Visibilty",y="Mean Departure Delay")
```
Mean departure delay for each factor of visibility was plot. The overall relationship is rather linear in nature indicating that as visibility worsens, mean flight departure delay increases my a measurable amount.

# Methodology

## Types of Models

Both Logistic Regression and K-Means Clustering were techniques employed in this study. Logistic regression is a statistical method commonly used for binary classification tasks, where the outcome variable is categorical with two levels (e.g., yes/no, 0/1). It models the relationship between one or more independent variables and the probability of the outcome occurring. The logistic regression model applies the logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function to the linear combination of the independent variables, transforming the output into a probability between 0 and 1. By setting a threshold or optimal cutoff, logistic regression classifies observations into one of the two categories. 

On the other hand, k-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct clusters based on similarity. It aims to group observations into k clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest centroid. The algorithm iteratively assigns observations to the nearest centroid and updates the centroids based on the mean of the assigned observations. K-means clustering works by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares, seeking to minimize the variance within clusters and maximize the variance between clusters.

## Data Tranformations

To test the classification accuracy of the logistic model, the data was split into a test and train set using the standard 70/30 split. A subset of the original data set was comprised of only continuous variables was created for k-means clustering as it is a distance based algorithm not applicable to categorical variables.


## Model 1 Logistic Regression

A logistic regression model was created to classify observations based on a derived variable of significant arrival delay. Significant arrival delay, denoted as sig_arr_delay is a binary factor with a 1 corresponding to a flight arriving at its destination greater than 7 minutes late, and a 0 corresponds to a flight being less than 7 minutes late. The mean arrival delay for all observations is 6.88 minutes, that is why the value of 7 was decided on for the split of the data into a binary factor suitable for logistic regression. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
data <- read.csv("NYCF.csv")
data$sig_arr_delay <- ifelse(data$arr_delay > 7, "1", "0")
data <- data[!is.na(data$sig_arr_delay), ]
data$sig_arr_delay <- as.factor(data$sig_arr_delay)
Split <- sample(nrow(data), 0.70*nrow(data), replace=FALSE)
Train <- data[Split,]
Test <-  data[-Split,]
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
m1 <- glm(sig_arr_delay ~ air_time+made+dep_time+distance+wind_speed+visib, data=Train, family ='binomial')
summary(m1)
ll.null <- m1$null.deviance/-2
ll.proposed <- m1$deviance/-2

## McFadden's Pseudo R^2 = [ LL(Null) - LL(Proposed) ] / LL(Null)
(ll.null - ll.proposed) / ll.null

## The p-value for the R^2
1 - pchisq(2*(ll.proposed - ll.null), df=(length(m1$coefficients)-1))
```
As previously mentioned the response variable of significant arrival delay was used. All explanatory variables used are significant with the absolute value of the z-values being greater than 2 and the p-values being less than 0.05. The explanatory variables used were air time, time made up in the air, departure time, distance, wind speed, and visibility. The model had a McFadden's Pseudo R squared of .277 with p-value less than 0.05. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
predictions<-predict(m1, Test, type = 'response')

roc_curve <- roc(Test$sig_arr_delay, predictions)

optimal_cutoff <- coords(roc_curve, "best", ret = "threshold")

print(optimal_cutoff)
```
The probability optimal cutoff found for binary classification is 0.3578069.

```{r echo=FALSE}
labels <- ifelse(predictions> 0.3578069, '1', '0')
labels <- rep(labels, length.out = length(Test$sig_arr_delay))

conf_matrix <- table(labels, Test$sig_arr_delay)

df <- data.frame(labels = labels, sig = Test$sig_arr_delay)
head(df)

conf_matrix
table(labels == Test$sig_arr_delay)/length(Test$sig_arr_delay)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
TP <- 55097  # True positives
TN <- 20858  # True negatives
FP <- 9547  # False positives
FN <- 12222 # False negatives

# Calculate sensitivity (true positive rate)
sensitivity <- TP / (TP + FN)

# Calculate specificity (true negative rate)
specificity <- TN / (TN + FP)

# Calculate misclassification error rate
misclassification_error <- (FP + FN) / sum(conf_matrix)

sensitivity
specificity
misclassification_error
```
Examining the confusion matrix and calculating measures of accuracy, the model sensitivity or true positive rate was 82% and a specificity or true negative rate was 69%. The total mis-classification error rate was 22%. Resulting in a prediction accuracy of just shy of 80%.

## Model 2 K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering was utilized in an attempt to group similar observations for pattern recognition of common characteristics. A subset of the nycflights data was created containing only numerical variables. This data was then scaled to insure no single feature has a greater influence in distance calculations. In order to combat computational limitations a wss elbow plot and silhouette plot to find the optimal number of clusters were created with a subset 25,000 observations. The k-means algorithm then employed all 325,000 observations. 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
numeric_data1 <- data  %>% slice(1:25000) %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) 
numeric_data1 <- numeric_data1[,c("dep_time","sched_dep_time","dep_delay","arr_time","arr_delay","air_time","distance","made","temp","wind_dir","wind_speed","wind_gust","visib")]
numeric_data1 <- na.omit(numeric_data1)
numeric_data <- numeric_data1[, !names(numeric_data1) %in% "precip"]
numeric_data <- numeric_data[, !names(numeric_data) %in% "year"]
numeric_data <- scale(numeric_data)
p1<-fviz_nbclust(numeric_data, kmeans, method = "wss", k.max = 8)
p2<-fviz_nbclust(numeric_data, kmeans, method = "silhouette", k.max = 8)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
numeric_data1 <- data %>% select_if(is.numeric) 
numeric_data1 <- numeric_data1[,c("dep_time","sched_dep_time","dep_delay","arr_time","arr_delay","air_time","distance","made","temp","wind_dir","wind_speed","wind_gust","visib")]
numeric_data1 <- na.omit(numeric_data1)
numeric_data <- numeric_data1[, !names(numeric_data1) %in% "precip"]
numeric_data <- numeric_data[, !names(numeric_data) %in% "year"]
numeric_data <- scale(numeric_data)

k3 <- kmeans(numeric_data, centers = 3, nstart = 1, iter.max = 10)
fviz_cluster(k3, data= numeric_data)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
k3$withinss
k3$tot.withinss
k3$betweenss
k3$size
numeric_data1$cluster <- k3$cluster
aggregate(numeric_data1, by=list(cluster=numeric_data1$cluster), mean)
```

Cluster 1 is the smallest by observation numbers, but contains the largest within cluster sum of squares. The spread out nature of cluster 1 can also be noticed in the plot above. 22.5% of variability in the data set is accounted for by the variability between clusters, this suggests a lackluster level of distinction between clusters. Examining the cluster means the only noticeable differences seem to arise in departure time, scheduled departure time, departure delay, arrival time, arrival delay, and time made up in the air.

```{r echo=FALSE}
f <- arrange(numeric_data1, desc(dep_time))
a <- arrange(numeric_data1, dep_time)
head(f)
head(a)

f2 <- arrange(numeric_data1, desc(dep_delay))
a2 <- arrange(numeric_data1, dep_delay)
head(f2)
head(a2)
```

Arranging some observations we can see that flights with late departure times seem to be assigned to cluster 1 for the most part. Flights with early departure times are assigned to a mixed bag of either cluster 1 or 3, suggesting the model doesn't know where to cluster these observations. Flights with the greatest departure delay are all assigned to cluster 1, and the flights with the smallest departure delay (left early) are assigned to a mixed number of clusters. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(numeric_data1, aes(x=dep_time,y=dep_delay, color=as.factor(cluster)))+geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=0.1)+theme_bw()+

# Results

## Model 1 Logistic Regression

The logistic regression model built correctly predicted the binary outcome of significant arrival delay 77.7% of the time. Significant arrival delay was a derived binary factor variable from arrival delay, if a flight arrival time was more than 7 minutes late the value of true (1) was assigned, less than 7 minutes late the value of false was assigned (0). The explanatory variables used to build the model were air time, time made up in the air, departure time, flight distance, wind speed, and visibility. These 6 independent variables were all significant predictors with p values less than 0.05 and the absolute value of their z values being greater than 2 signifying statistical significance from zero. The deviance residuals are centered close to zero and the residual deviance was less than the null deviance indicating the explanatory variables contribute to model fit. Examining the coefficient estimates, The intercept or the log odds of a flight being delayed is -1.598. For a one unit increase in air time, the log odds for the flight being delayed decrease 0.00215. For a one unit increase in time made up in the air, the log odds for the flight being delayed decrease 0.08733. For a one unit increase in departure time, the log odds of the flight being delayed increases 0.001452. For a one unit increase in distance, the log odds of the flight being delayed increases 0.000328. For a one unit increase in wind speed, the log odds of the flight being delayed increases 0.01331. For a one unit increase in visibility, the log odds of the flight being delayed decrease 0.1163. 

## Model 2 K-Means Clustering

The results from the K-Means Clustering model built appear to be less conclusive. This can be attributed to the lack of variance retained from the original numeric data set in dimensionality reduction. For K-Means, Principal Component Analysis is used to reduce the input data to two dimensions, making it suitable for the distance based K-Means algorithm. Dimension 1 accounted for 21.3% of variance in the original data set and dimension 2 accounted for 16.7% of variance in the original data set, summing to 38%. Three distinct clusters were formed although these clusters did see vast overlap among outer points and points further from the cluster centroids. Examining cluster means, cluster 1 averaged the latest departure time in the day for departing flights, it also featured the highest departure and arrival delay among clusters. While being the most delayed, cluster 1 did also average a value of -3.4 for time made up in the air, signifying that flights on average spent 3.4 more minutes in the air than scheduled. Cluster 2 featured a mean value for departure time, departure delay, and arrival delay between that of cluster 1 and cluster 3. Cluster 2 had the highest mean value for time made up in the air of 8.5 minutes, denoting that on average flights in cluster 2 spent 8.5 minutes less in the air than predicted. Cluster 3 feature the lowest mean departure time, departure delay, and arrival delay while the mean time made up in the air fell between that of cluster 1 and 2.

Multiple conclusions can be drawn from the cluster means. First, the later the departure time in the day, the higher the average departure and arrival delay among flights. Second, flights leaving earliest in the day arrive earliest in comparison to their scheduled arrival times despite not making up the most time in the air among clusters. Third, flights departing in the afternoon to late afternoon make up the most time in the air on average.

# Discussion

## Final model interpolation

As mentioned above, both models created give valuable insights in the daily operations of commercial aircraft. The logistic regression model allows prediction of probability for a binary outcome, then classifying that observation based on its predicted probability. K-Mean Clustering groups similar observations allowing for trends and patterns to be recognized. Conclusions were drawn from logistic regression using the log odds for coefficient estimates and test set to test model accuracy. Conclusions were drawn from K-Mean using cluster means and cluster assignments for various observations. 

## Use of Model

Future use cases for the logistic regression model built to classify significant arrival delay include but are not limited to, flight scheduling, arrival predictions, traffic management, and operation logistics planning. The model could be integrated into airport capacity planning systems to optimize resource allocation and mitigate congestion during peak hours. Furthermore, airlines could utilize the model to enhance customer service by proactively managing delays and informing passengers about potential disruptions. Additionally, government agencies responsible for transportation infrastructure could leverage the insights generated by the model to improve overall system efficiency and reliability. Overall, the versatility of the logistic regression model extends beyond solely arrival delay classification.

Future use cases for the K-Means Clustering model built include travel patterns, demand forecasting, and route optimization. For instance, airlines can identify high-demand routes or peak travel times, allowing for more strategic scheduling and resource allocation. Moreover, k-means clustering enables airlines to segment their customer base more effectively, tailoring services and marketing efforts to different traveler preferences. Overall, leveraging logistic regression and k-means clustering in commercial aviation facilitates data-driven decision-making and offers valuable insights for enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

# Furture Work

To build more accurate and tailored models deployable to production level standards, more time should be spent methodically imputing missing values and detecting potential outliers specific to the agency or corporation utilizing the the various models built. By creating subsets of the data set tailored to specific airports or airlines, organizations can fine-tune models to fit their unique data characteristics and operational requirements accurately. This customization enables airports or airlines to extract insights directly applicable to their operations, optimizing resource allocation, enhancing customer service, and ultimately improving overall efficiency. By prioritizing data pre-processing techniques and customization efforts, organizations can develop models that not only meet but exceed production standards, driving meaningful impact within the aviation industry.
